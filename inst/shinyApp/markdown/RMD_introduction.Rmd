###  ***shinyBN*** is an R/Shiny application for interactive inference and visualization of Bayesian network.

#### It's based on five R packages:
> + [`bnlearn`](http://www.bnlearn.com/):  Structure learning and parameter training
> + [`gRain`](http://people.math.aau.dk/~sorenh/software/gR/):  Network inference
> + [`visNetwork`](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/):  Network visualization
> + [`pROC`](https://web.expasy.org/pROC/):  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plot
> + [`rmda`](http://mdbrown.github.io/rmda/):  Decision Curves Analysis (DCA) plot

#### Which is further wrapped by [`R/Shiny`]('http://shiny.rstudio.com/'). It's friendly to users and can easily use through the following workflow :
